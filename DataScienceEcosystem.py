# ## Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# ### Introduction
# 
# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# #### Objectives:
#  
#  - Listing popular languages for Data Science
#  - Listing some libraries for Data Science
#  - some of the data science tool
#  - evaluating some arithmetic expressions 
#   

# #### Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
#     
#     1. Python
#     2. R
#     3. Scala
#     4. Java
#     5. Julia

# #### Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
#     
#     1. NumPy
#     2. Keras
#     3. Pandas
#     4. PyTorch
#     5. SciPy

# #### Data Science Tools

# | Python                   | A versatile programming language for data analysis and machine learning. | [python.org](https://www.python.org/)            
# | Jupyter Notebook         | An interactive web-based notebook for data exploration and analysis. | [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/)              
# | R                        | A programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. | [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)     
# | Pandas                   | A Python library for data manipulation and analysis. | [pandas.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
# | NumPy                    | A Python library for numerical computations and array operations. | [numpy.org](https://numpy.org/)

# 

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
#  
#  #### Addition
#    5+3 = 8
#  
#  #### Substraction
#    10-3 = 7
#    
#  #### Multiplication
#    2*3 = 6
#  
#  #### Division
#    9/3 = 3
# 

# In[5]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

a = 5
b = 3
c = 2
print((a*b)+c)


# In[7]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

minutes = 200

hours = minutes/60
print(hours)
